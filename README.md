*Wutup* is a social event management service.  The service permits creating and promoting events,
inviting friends to events, and checking into events.  Events can be searched by category, geography, 
sponsor, or date range.  The service connects to social networking sites like facebook and twitter
for promotion and checkin.  The service exposes a RESTful API so developers can generate any number 
of clients (web, mobile web, iOS, Android, an so on).

The project was developed by the LMU CMSI 401 Software Engineering Laboratory class in fall, 2012.
