Yo! **Wutup** is a social event management service that allows users to create and promote events,
invite friends to events, and checkin to events.  Events can be searched by category, geography, 
sponsor, or date range.  The service connects to social networking sites like facebook and twitter
for promotion and checkin, and exposes a RESTful API so developers can generate any number 
of clients (web, mobile web, iOS, Android, an so on).

The project was developed by the LMU CMSI 401 Software Engineering Laboratory class in fall, 2012.
